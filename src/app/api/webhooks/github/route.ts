/**
 * GitHub webhook ingest (#562).
 *
 * The admission order is deliberate and is the substance of this change:
 *
 *   size → delivery id → signature → parse → dispatch on event
 *
 * The route previously dispatched on `x-github-event` *first* and verified the
 * signature second, so an unauthenticated caller sending `x-github-event: push`
 * received `200 {"message":"Event not tracked"}`. Beyond being a free
 * unauthenticated 200 and an oracle for "endpoint exists" vs "signature
 * rejected", it meant `ping` — GitHub's very first delivery when a webhook is
 * registered — was answered without the secret ever being exercised, so a
 * webhook configured with the wrong secret looked healthy in the GitHub UI.
 *
 * The verification primitives live in `src/lib/github/webhook-verification.ts`
 * so each branch is unit-testable without constructing a request.
