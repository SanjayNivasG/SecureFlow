/**
 * Who may enqueue a scan, and against what (#748).
 *
 * `POST /api/findings` and `GET /api/findings/status/[jobId]` shipped without
 * an `auth()` call. `src/proxy.ts` only guards `/admin` and `/api/admin`, so
 * nothing upstream covered them either — the sole control on the POST was a
 * 10/minute rate limit, which bounds how often an anonymous caller can do this
 * and not whether they may.
 *
 * The fields that decide what the scan touches all came from the request body:
 *
 *  - `repositoryFullName` and `prNumber` are handed to
 *    `octokit.rest.checks.create` and `octokit.rest.issues.createComment`, so an
 *    unauthenticated request could make SecureFlow's GitHub App post a check run
 *    and a comment on any pull request in any repository the app is installed
 *    on;
 *  - `repositoryId` selected which repository's `FindingTriage` rows were read
 *    and which repository the `ScanResult` was attached to;
 *  - `userId` was optional, unchecked, and used for exactly one thing —
 *    the `AuditLog` row's actor. An audit log a stranger can write arbitrary
 *    attributions into is not an audit log.
 *
 * The shape of the fix is the one `src/lib/actions/triage.ts` already uses: the
 * caller names a repository id, the repository is loaded scoped to the session
 * user, and everything else is read off the row that comes back rather than off
 * the request. A caller can only ever direct the scanner at a repository the
 * lookup already proved they own.
 *
 * The Prisma surfaces are narrowed to interfaces so the decisions can be tested
 * without a database.

 *  - `activePolicies`, because policy rules are derived server-side from
 *    database templates and user toggles, so a client cannot disable or alter
 *    security policies by sending an empty or modified array (#1).
 *  - `fileChanges`, because accepting caller-supplied file diffs allows a

 *    content, causing the scanner to assess code the PR never contained (#3).
 *    The scan engine always fetches the authoritative diff from the GitHub API
 *    using the authenticated installation token.
 *
 * `installationId` is still accepted — `Repository` carries no installation id
 * to derive it from — but it can no longer be used to reach another account's
 * repositories, because the repository name it is combined with now comes from
 * a row the caller was proven to own. An installation id that does not cover
